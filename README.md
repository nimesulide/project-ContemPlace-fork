Every AI agent you use builds memory about you — but in its own proprietary garden. You can't move it, combine it, or extract it without non-trivial effort. Every time you try a new tool, you start from zero.

ContemPlace is the fix. An MCP-connected database that *you* own. Send raw input from any interface — a Telegram bot, Claude CLI, a custom script, anything that speaks MCP. The system structures it, embeds it, links it to your prior thinking, and makes it semantically searchable. A gardening pipeline runs in the background to normalize, connect, and chunk your notes so retrieval keeps getting better. Your accumulated context travels with you.

No proprietary format. No vendor lock-in. Postgres you can always query and export. The stack runs on free tiers — average use costs $2–3/month in LLM calls.

## How it works

1. You send a thought — raw text, voice transcription, a link, whatever
2. The capture agent structures it: title, body, tags, type, intent, entities — and links it to related notes
3. Your exact words are always preserved alongside the structured note — enrichment is non-destructive, so future agents can reinterpret the same input with better models
4. A nightly gardener refines connections: similarity links, tag normalization, chunking for retrieval

## MCP tools

The MCP server is the primary interface. Eight tools, usable by any MCP-capable agent:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `search_notes` | Search notes by meaning. Ranked results with body text. Filter by type, intent, tags. |
| `search_chunks` | Search within paragraphs of long notes (body > 1500 chars). |
| `get_note` | Fetch a single note — body, raw_input (source of truth), entities, links, corrections. |
| `list_recent` | Most recent notes, newest first. Filter by type or intent. |
| `get_related` | All linked notes in both directions with link types and confidence. |
| `capture_note` | Pass raw words — the server runs the full capture pipeline. Do not pre-structure. |
| `list_unmatched_tags` | Tags without SKOS concept matches, with frequency. Curation workflow. |
| `promote_concept` | Add a concept to the SKOS vocabulary for synonym normalization. |

**Auth:** OAuth 2.1 (Authorization Code + PKCE) for browser clients like Claude.ai, or a static Bearer token for API/SDK callers like Claude Code CLI. Both paths are permanent.

## Modules

The database + MCP server is the only required piece. Everything else is optional.

| Module | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP server** | Exposes the note graph to any MCP-capable agent. The core interface. | ✅ Live |
| **Telegram capture bot** | Zero-friction note capture from your phone. Message the bot, get a structured note back. | ✅ Live |
| **Gardening pipeline** | Nightly enrichment: similarity links, SKOS tag normalization, chunk generation. | ✅ Complete |
| **Dashboard** | Browser-based view — search, browse, follow links, see the graph. | 💡 Planned |
| **Obsidian import** | Pull an existing vault into the database. | 💡 Planned |
| **ChatGPT memory import** | Rescue accumulated context from a proprietary format. | 💡 Planned |
| **Smart capture router** | Auto-detect input type: short notes, URLs, brain dumps, lists. | 💡 Design phase |

## Philosophy

**Your context travels with you.** Any MCP-capable agent can read and write your knowledge base. Switch tools, try new agents, combine workflows — your accumulated context comes along.

**You never think about the system.** Send a thought; structure emerges automatically. Tags, intent, entities, and links happen in the background. Low friction isn't a feature — it's the reason this works at all.

**Value compounds the more you use it.** Note 1 is just a note. Note 50 starts forming clusters. Note 200 has a graph where ideas reinforce, contradict, and extend each other — and you didn't build that graph manually. The gardening pipeline tightens the mesh in the background. The more you capture, the richer the context any agent has when it reads your memory.

**The primary consumer is your agents, not you.** You rarely browse notes directly. You ask an AI something and it pulls from your memory via MCP — semantic search, related notes, entity lookups. The database is designed for machine retrieval first, which means any MCP-capable tool gets full access to your accumulated thinking.

**Your ideas become a graph you can explore.** Notes cluster around themes over time. Some nodes gain gravitational weight. Structure isn't imposed; it emerges from the accumulation of linked, gardened notes.

**You own your data.** Postgres. Query it, export it, migrate it. Raw input is always preserved — not as a backup, but as the irreplaceable source of truth. Today's LLM interprets your words one way; tomorrow's can reinterpret the same raw input with better understanding. Enrichment is always additive, never destructive. No proprietary format, no walled garden.

## FAQ

### What kind of notes does this store?

Anything you'd want to find again. The capture agent classifies each note by type and intent automatically. In practice, a typical database ends up with:

- **Project ideas** — things to build, one concept per note
- **Technical references** — things you looked up and want to find again
- **Research breadcrumbs** — things to follow up on
- **Source notes** — references to videos, articles, or conversations that sparked ideas
- **Reflections** — shorter, personal notes about energy, motivation, or creative identity

The system doesn't care about categories. You never have to pick one. You send raw text; the capture agent figures out the rest. The patterns above aren't folders — they emerge from real usage.

### Why preserve the raw input?

Every note stores two things: the structured note (title, body, tags, links) and your exact original words in `raw_input`. The structured version is the LLM's interpretation — useful for search and retrieval today. But models improve. A year from now, a better model can re-read your raw input and extract richer meaning, catch nuances the current model missed, or classify things differently. Because enrichment is non-destructive — it only adds columns and links, never overwrites `raw_input` — your database gets smarter over time without losing anything. You're not locked into today's LLM's understanding of what you said.

### Does value really scale with more notes?

Yes, and nonlinearly. A single note is just text with metadata. But the capture agent links each new note to existing ones — `extends`, `supports`, `contradicts` — so every note you add creates new edges in the graph. The nightly gardener finds similarity links you didn't ask for and normalizes tags so different phrasings converge. After a few hundred notes, ask any MCP agent "what are my recurring themes?" or "what contradicts this idea?" and the graph does the work. You never organized anything manually. The structure emerged from accumulation.

### How does structure emerge?

No folders, no hierarchy, no manual organization. Every note is atomic — one idea, one reference, one reflection. Structure comes from three mechanisms:

1. **Capture-time linking** — the LLM compares your note against existing notes and creates typed edges (`extends`, `contradicts`, `supports`, `is-example-of`, `duplicate-of`)
2. **Similarity linking** — the gardening pipeline finds notes with high cosine similarity and connects them with `is-similar-to` links
3. **Tag normalization** — free-form tags are matched against a SKOS concept vocabulary, so "laser cutting" and "laser cutter" resolve to the same concept

Over time, clusters form naturally. Any MCP-capable agent can surface them — ask "what are my instrument-building ideas?" and the graph does the work.

<details>
<summary><strong>What the capture agent produces</strong></summary>

Each note gets 10 fields from a single LLM pass:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **title** | A claim or insight — not a topic label |
| **body** | 1–8 sentences (scales with input length), atomic, in the user's own voice |
| **type** | `idea` / `reflection` / `source` / `lookup` |
| **intent** | `reflect` / `plan` / `create` / `remember` / `reference` / `log` |
| **modality** | `text` / `link` / `list` / `mixed` |
| **tags** | Free-form, from the input |
| **entities** | Proper nouns with types (person, place, tool, project, concept) |
| **links** | Typed edges to related notes |
| **corrections** | Voice dictation fixes, applied silently and reported |
| **source_ref** | URL if one was included |

The body follows a strict traceability rule: every sentence must trace back to something you actually said. The agent transcribes, not interprets.

Input can come from voice dictation. The agent detects and silently corrects transcription errors, cross-referencing proper nouns against existing notes. Corrections are shown in the reply.
