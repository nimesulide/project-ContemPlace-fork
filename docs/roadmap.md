# Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Capture pipeline (complete)

The foundation: a Telegram bot backed by a Cloudflare Worker that captures messages into Supabase with pgvector embeddings and semantic linking.

Delivered:
- Telegram webhook handler with async background processing
- Chat ID whitelist and webhook secret verification
- Deduplication via `processed_updates` table
- LLM-generated structured notes (title, body, type, tags, source_ref)
- Semantic search via `match_notes()` RPC with cosine similarity
- Typed links between notes (`extends`, `contradicts`, `supports`, `is-example-of`)
- HTML-formatted Telegram confirmation replies
- Smoke tests against the live Worker

## Phase 1.5 — Enriched capture (complete)

Expanded the data model and capture logic. The schema was rebuilt from scratch (v2) with all Phase 2 infrastructure pre-created.

Delivered:
- **Schema v2:** 8 tables (notes, links, concepts, note_concepts, note_chunks, enrichment_log, capture_profiles, processed_updates) with RLS, HNSW indexes, and seeded data
- **Classification taxonomy:** `intent` (6 values), `modality` (4 values), `entities` (proper nouns with typed categories)
- **Two-pass embedding:** Raw text for lookup, metadata-augmented for storage, with fallback
- **System prompt split:** Structural contract in code (`SYSTEM_FRAME`), stylistic rules in database (`capture_profiles`)
- **Enrichment log:** Audit trail per note per enrichment type, batched inserts
- **Hybrid search:** `match_notes()` with 8 parameters including intent filter and full-text search
- **SKOS concepts:** 10 seeded domain concepts for future tag normalization
- **Parser hardening:** 17 unit tests covering all fallback paths
- **Automated deploy:** `scripts/deploy.sh` runs schema → typecheck → unit tests → Worker deploy → smoke tests
- **Voice correction:** LLM detects and silently fixes transcription errors, reports in Telegram reply

## Phase 2a — MCP server (complete)

Exposes the note database to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol. The primary client is Claude Code (CLI). Deployed as a separate Cloudflare Worker at `mcp-contemplace.adamfreisinger.workers.dev`.

Eight tools:
- **`search_notes`** — semantic search via `match_notes()` with optional type/intent/tag filters
- **`search_chunks`** — chunk-level semantic search via `match_chunks()` for fine-grained RAG retrieval
- **`get_note`** — full note retrieval with linked notes and entity data
- **`list_recent`** — recent notes with optional facet filtering
- **`get_related`** — notes connected to a given note via the `links` table
- **`capture_note`** — full capture pipeline (embed → related lookup → LLM → store), same logic as Telegram but synchronous and source-tagged
- **`list_unmatched_tags`** — tags that haven't matched any SKOS concept, with frequency; for vocabulary curation
- **`promote_concept`** — insert a new concept into the SKOS vocabulary interactively

Auth: single API key (Bearer token). `MCP_SEARCH_THRESHOLD` (default 0.35) is separate from `MATCH_THRESHOLD` (0.60) — bare query vectors score lower against metadata-augmented stored embeddings.

`mcp/src/capture.ts` is a deliberate copy of `src/capture.ts` (Cloudflare Workers cannot share code across Worker projects without monorepo tooling). The `tests/mcp-parser.test.ts` parity tests enforce that the copies stay in sync.

In scope after the MCP server is live: import scripts for **ChatGPT memory export** and **Obsidian vault** — standalone Node.js scripts that loop `capture_note` calls with appropriate source tags.

### Real-world test findings (2026-03-10)

First live test against 6 notes via Claude Code confirmed all five tools work correctly. One configuration issue found:

**Threshold mismatch** — `search_notes` returned 0 results at the default threshold (0.60). Dropping to 0.30 surfaced relevant results (scores 0.41–0.49). The root cause is that stored embeddings are metadata-augmented (`[Type: idea] [Intent: plan] [Tags: …] text`) while search queries are bare natural language. The single `MATCH_THRESHOLD` env var was calibrated for capture-time related-note lookup (higher precision needed), not for agent search (broader exploration).

Fix: add `MCP_SEARCH_THRESHOLD` (default 0.35) as a separate config value used only by `handleSearchNotes`. `MATCH_THRESHOLD` (0.60) stays for `findRelatedNotes` inside `capture_note`. See `docs/decisions.md` for full analysis.

**`get_related` UX note** — the tool requires a note `id`. A text-based "find notes related to this topic" lookup is a natural UX expectation. Tracked as a candidate tool (`search_related`?) for a later phase.

## Phase 2b — Gardening pipeline (in progress) — issue #2

A separate Cloudflare Worker (`contemplace-gardener`) that enriches the note graph in the background. Runs nightly at 02:00 UTC via cron trigger, also triggerable via `POST /trigger` with Bearer auth. Sends failure alerts to Telegram.

Three phases run sequentially, each error-isolated:

### Similarity linker — delivered (PR #30, v2.1.0)

Pairwise cosine similarity across all notes via `find_similar_pairs` RPC (self-join). Inserts `is-similar-to` links above `GARDENER_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (0.70) with `created_by = 'gardener'` and `confidence` = similarity score. Auto-generated context from shared tags and entities via `buildContext()`. Clean-slate delete + reinsert for idempotency.

### SKOS tag normalization — delivered (PR #41)

Maps free-form note tags to the SKOS controlled vocabulary (`concepts` table). Hybrid matching: lexical match against `pref_label` + `alt_labels` first, embedding similarity fallback at `GARDENER_TAG_MATCH_THRESHOLD` (0.55). Populates `notes.refined_tags` (pref_labels only) and `note_concepts` junction. Unmatched tags logged to `enrichment_log` as `type = 'unmatched_tag'` for curation via MCP tools. Uses `batch_update_refined_tags` RPC to stay within CF Workers subrequest budget. 32 seed concepts across 4 schemes (domains, tools, people, places).

### Chunk generation — delivered (PR #44)

Splits long notes (body > 1500 chars) into ~500–800 char chunks at paragraph boundaries, with sentence and newline fallbacks. Embeds each chunk with title + tag prefix (`{title} [{tags}]: {chunk_text}`). Body hash idempotency via SHA-256 in `enrichment_log.metadata` — only re-chunks when body content changes. Embed-first-insert-second to avoid orphan chunks. Enables `search_chunks` MCP tool for fine-grained RAG retrieval.

### Subrequest budget optimization — delivered (PR #42)

Reduced gardener subrequests from ~12 + 2N to ~16 fixed via two new RPC functions: `batch_update_refined_tags` (JSONB batch UPDATE) and `find_similar_pairs` (self-join replaces N individual `match_notes` calls). At 300 notes: 16 subrequests instead of 612.

### Maturity/importance scoring — deferred

User's mental model is emergent MOC-style graph evolution (maps of content as gravitational centers, freshness = recently linked, density = many relations). Closer to community detection than per-note scoring. Needs real graph patterns to design well. ADR recorded in `docs/decisions.md`.

### Alerting and manual trigger — delivered (PRs #36, #37)

Best-effort Telegram failure alerts (`sendAlert()`). Optional `POST /trigger` endpoint with Bearer auth (`GARDENER_API_KEY`). Integration test exercises the full cycle: capture → trigger → assert DB state.

### Schema infrastructure already in place

The v2 schema was designed with Phase 2 in mind. These columns and tables are now partially populated by the gardener:

- `notes.refined_tags` — populated by tag normalization
- `note_chunks` table — populated by chunk generation
- `note_concepts` junction table — populated by tag normalization
- `concepts` table — 32 seeded concepts with embeddings
- `enrichment_log` — records all gardener activity with metadata

Still unpopulated: `notes.summary`, `notes.categories`, `notes.importance_score` (defaults to NULL), `notes.maturity` (defaults to `seedling`).

## Phase 2c — OAuth 2.1 (next) — issue #5

Add OAuth 2.1 authentication to the MCP server for browser-based clients (Claude.ai web, ChatGPT, Cursor). Uses `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` with KV-backed opaque tokens and Dynamic Client Registration. Static `MCP_API_KEY` kept permanently for API/SDK callers. Plan doc: `docs/phase-2c-oauth-plan.md`.

## Phase 3 — Associative trails and beyond (deferred)

**Associative trails** — Curated or auto-generated sequences of notes that tell a story or trace a line of thinking. The `trails` and `trail_steps` tables were designed but not created in v2.

**Type inheritance** — A `note_types` table that defines custom types with inheritance, allowing user-defined specializations beyond the four base types.

**Location extraction** — For input channels that support geotags (future mobile app), extract and store location data.

**Additional input channels** — The capture pipeline is channel-agnostic by design. Adding Slack, email, voice, or a web interface means writing a new entry point that calls the same embed → LLM → store flow. The `source` field records provenance.
